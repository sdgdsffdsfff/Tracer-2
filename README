Tracer is a web-based XDebug trace file analyzer. Currently, it provides a 
simple interface for selecting trace files for analysis and relatively simple 
reports as well as a complete dump of the trace file. In it's present state, it 
is not recommended for any real 'hard' work. It is still in its infancy so user
beware - it can make some really interesting things happen.

To use:
1. I strongly recommend creating a separate virtual host for Tracer.
2. Use the recommended settings for xdebug in the 'xdebug-settings.txt' file.
3. Restart apache (Duh)
4. Put 'xdebug_start_trace()' in your PHP code where you want to start tracing.
5. Execute your code.
6. Load Tracer in your browser and analyze.

An internet connection will be needed since Tracer currently relies on Google 
Graphs API and some other external libraries.

It has not been tested on Windows machines or Mac to my knowledge so I have no 
idea what to expect on those platforms.

This is by no means a complete and comprehensive analysis of your application, 
but it should give you a general idea of bottlenecks in your code. Myself and 
others will be making regular improvements to Tracer (at least until we figure 
out which OSS license we want to use), so if you have ideas or suggestions for 
changes or improvements, please let us know.

Tracer has not yet been analyzed by itself. If your curious, knock yourself out.
I'm waiting until it has a bit more meat on its bones. :)
